## My idea

The idea for my website came from a festival in Malta I had booked back in 2019. Due to covid, the festival had been postponed to 2022. All of my friends were unable to make the new dates, but I still wanted to go!

I must not be the only person this has happened to, and thought it would have been a good idea for the festival to put these people in touch so they can find other people to go with.

I created an app for festivals abroad, where you click attending to a festival, and post details about your trip such as dates flying out, and the activities/artists you want to go to there, eg. Castle rave/ pool party. Then people can find you and message you.

## Main features

- Messaging function (1 on 1 messaging)
- Festival page and "Attending" post
- Public Profile
- Register and login
